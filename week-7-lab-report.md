# Part 2
Doing the first run I got: 1:22:30
And with the second I got: 0:44:93

I definitely prefer the second, since vim allows for quicker movement and 
for a ton of optimization with running commands and editing small things quickly.

The task seemed to be a little easier for VScode since it has search and replace built in but, I still enjoy not having to move from the keyboard and just being able to type a ton of interesting commands to complete a task.
